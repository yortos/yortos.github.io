_The adaptability of a flexible partner, combined with the capabilities of an in-house data science and BizOps expert._

I specialize in assisting businesses in establishing robust data infrastructure, creating easily understandable KPIs to monitor success, and leveraging data insights to inform high-level decision-making and strategic direction.


## Portfolio Highlights



## Academic and Professional Overview
I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Athens, Greece, and a **PhD in Computer Science from Northwestern University**, Evanston, IL. My PhD research focused on the [dynamics of online review platforms](https://www.proquest.com/openview/852c4109961853cc539e34470217a915/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750) (such as Amazon, Yelp and the Apple AppStore), blending mathematical modeling, with real-world experiments and large scale data analysis.

I was a part of the **Spotify Notifications team for two years, collaborating with User Research, Product, and Engineering to enhance user engagement through timely and valuable notifications**. Additionally, I contributed for one year within the Finance team, playing a key role in **developing the future user growth forecast**. This forecast informed resource allocation decisions by the CFO and guided external shareholder communications. I presented this impactful work at the [Rev2 Data Science conference in NYC](youtube.com/watch?v=tkmWXM0egqg).

During my three years at **Instagram, I spearheaded user growth by driving the redesign of the [Web interface](https://www.instagram.com/), and strategically launching features like Messaging and Post Creation on Desktop**. I wrote a blog post about [Launching Messaging on Desktop](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/26/web/launching-instagram-messaging-on-desktop/)

My academic background and industry expertise converge to offer strategic insights and actionable solutions. I'm eager to explore how I can elevate your business.
