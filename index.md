The adaptability of a flexible partner, combined with the capabilities of an in-house data science and BizOps expert.

I specialize in assisting businesses in establishing robust data infrastructure, creating easily understandable KPIs to monitor success, and leveraging data insights to inform high-level decision-making and strategic direction.

## Academic and Professional Overview
I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Athens, Greece, and a PhD in Computer Science from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. My PhD research focused on the dynamics of online review platforms (such as Amazon, Yelp and the Apple AppStore), blending mathematical modeling and data analysis.

I was a part of the Spotify Notifications team for two years, collaborating with User Research, Product, and Engineering to enhance user engagement through timely and valuable notifications. Additionally, I contributed for one year within the Finance team, playing a key role in developing the future user growth forecast. This forecast informed resource allocation decisions by the CFO and guided external shareholder communications. I presented this impactful work at the [Rev2 Data Science conference in NYC](youtube.com/watch?v=tkmWXM0egqg).

During my three years at Instagram, I spearheaded user growth by driving the redesign of the Web interface, and strategically launching features like Messaging and Post Creation on Desktop. I wrote a blog post about [Launching Messaging on Desktop](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/26/web/launching-instagram-messaging-on-desktop/)

My academic background and industry expertise converge to offer strategic insights and actionable solutions. I'm eager to explore how I can elevate your business.
